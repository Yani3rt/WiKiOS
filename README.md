# WikiOS

WikiOS turns an Obsidian vault into a local web app. It lets you browse notes through a homepage, search, article pages, a graph view, and stats.

This repository is maintained at [Yani3rt/WiKiOS](https://github.com/Yani3rt/WiKiOS).

## What it does

- Connects to an Obsidian-compatible markdown folder
- Builds a local searchable index
- Gives you a clean web interface for exploring your notes
- Watches the vault for changes and updates the index automatically
- Lets you switch vaults later from the in-app setup flow

## How to get started

Clone and launch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yani3rt/WiKiOS.git wiki-os && cd wiki-os && npm run first-run
```

WikiOS will open in your browser and guide you through choosing a vault. You can also use the bundled demo vault on first run.

## Features

- Homepage with featured notes, recent notes, topic sections, and people highlights
- Global command palette (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`) with recent notes and instant note search
- Fast local search on the homepage
- Full note viewer with:
  - table of contents
  - connected / related notes
  - reading metadata
  - person controls
  - Mermaid diagram rendering
  - polished Markdown tables
  - copy buttons on fenced code blocks
- Dedicated Wiki Explorer with:
  - searchable folder tree
  - folder expand / collapse controls
  - desktop hide / show sidebar controls
  - persistent tabbed reading workspace
  - shared note viewer that matches direct wiki pages
- Graph view with topic-based node coloring
- Stats view
- Manual reindex support
- Automatic file watching
- Local-first setup with no cloud requirement

## Note categories and topics

WikiOS derives note categories from three sources, in this order:

1. frontmatter
2. folder path
3. content heuristics (only when the first two do not provide topics)

By default, these frontmatter keys are treated as note categories:

- `tags`
- `topics`
- `topic`
- `category`
- `categories`

Example:

```md
---
tags:
  - philosophy
  - writing
---
```

Folder names can also become note topics. By default, WikiOS uses up to two folder levels and ignores structural folders such as `notes/`, `topics/`, `docs/`, and `sources/`.

### Docker

You can run WikiOS with Docker if you want a simple container setup.

This starts WikiOS with the bundled demo vault:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file is in the main project folder.

By default, Docker uses the demo notes in `sample-vault/`.

If you want to use your own Obsidian vault instead:

1. Open `docker-compose.yml`
2. Find this line:

```yml
- ./sample-vault:/vault:ro
```

3. Replace `./sample-vault` with the path to your own vault

Example:

```yml
- /Users/your-name/Documents/MyVault:/vault:ro
```

Leave `WIKI_ROOT: /vault` as it is.

For a direct build and run:

```bash
docker build -t wiki-os .
docker run --rm -p 5211:5211 -e WIKI_ROOT=/vault -v /path/to/your/vault:/vault:ro -v wiki-os-data:/data wiki-os
```

## Contributor mode

For normal users, use:

```bash
npm start
```

For contributors working on WikiOS itself, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

`dev` runs a split frontend/backend setup for faster iteration.

During development, Setup can be used to switch to a different vault later at:

```bash
http://localhost:5211/setup?change=1
```

If you started the app with `WIKIOS_FORCE_WIKI_ROOT`, vault switching is intentionally locked for that process until you restart without it.

## Folder structure

- `src/client/` contains the React app, routes, and UI components
- `src/server/` contains the Fastify server, setup flow, runtime config, and platform helpers
- `src/lib/` contains the wiki core
- `sample-vault/` contains the bundled demo content
- `scripts/` contains launch, deploy, and smoke-test helpers

## Advanced

### Useful commands

- `npm run first-run` installs dependencies and starts the guided first-run flow
- `npm start` starts the app in user mode
- `npm run dev` starts the contributor split client/server setup
- `npm run build` builds the client and server
- `npm run serve` runs the already-built server
- `npm run deploy` runs the deployment helper
- `npm run smoke-test` runs the smoke test helper
- `docker compose up --build` runs the app in Docker with the bundled demo vault

### Environment variables

- `WIKI_ROOT` bootstraps the app with a vault path
- `WIKIOS_FORCE_WIKI_ROOT` forces a temporary per-process vault override
- `PORT` sets the server port
- `WIKIOS_INDEX_DB` overrides the SQLite index path
- `WIKIOS_ADMIN_TOKEN` protects the manual reindex endpoint
- `WIKIOS_DISABLE_WATCH=1` disables filesystem watching

By default, WikiOS saves the selected vault in `~/.wiki-os/config.json` and stores hashed SQLite indexes under `~/.wiki-os/indexes/`.

### People model

WikiOS treats `People` as an explicit, user-controlled concept first. By default it recognizes people from:

- frontmatter keys like `person`, `people`, `type`, `kind`, and `entity`
- tags like `person`, `people`, `biography`, and `biographies`
- folders like `people/`, `person/`, `biographies/`, and `biography/`

You can customize this in `wiki-os.config.ts` with `people.mode`:

- `explicit` is the safest default
- `hybrid` allows broader inference after explicit metadata
- `off` hides People entirely

Local person overrides are saved in `~/.wiki-os/config.json` and do not rewrite your notes.

### Explorer and note experience

WikiOS now has two complementary reading flows:

- `/wiki/:slug` for direct note pages
- `/explorer/:slug` for a tabbed browsing workspace

Both routes share the same note viewer, so note presentation stays consistent across the app.
